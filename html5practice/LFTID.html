​   Dearest Reader, </p>

  <p>Hey there! I am going to write a book for you. A sensational book! ... Oh, if only that were the truth. Let’s face facts here, Reader. It’s the year 2011. I live during the first true age of distraction. I’m not some tormented Russian author living in the late 1800s; spending my nights by candlelight with nothing to do but toil under the pen searching out a justification for my grim existence. The difference now is that at the first sign of any sort of difficulty, or existential angst, I can simply entertain (read: distract) myself with a myriad of options that, until recently, were simply unavailable to us ignorant masses. And yet still, the feeling persists. 

  Sure, the powerful and wealthy of the world have always been able to fulfill their most perverse fantasies simply enough. But for commoners, most of us lacking official-looking uniforms and badges with which we might more easily exercise authority over others under the guise of divine privilege, maintaining the peace, or maybe this time it’s the spreading of liberty… whatever the case, our ability to live out our most lecherous thoughts without fear of repercussions has only been made a viable option in the past decade or so. 
  
  I’m referring, of course, to the advent of The Internet, or as I like to think of it, The Wish-granter. After all, at its most basic level, that’s clearly what it is. And we can hide from the true mysticism of its power all we want. Nonetheless, it persists. I need look no further than my own life to see this. Anything I’ve ever wanted, I have found on The Internet. Anytime I’ve needed a job, I asked The Internet, and It gave me one. If I wanted to hear a song, watch a movie, or make a new friend, It would provide me with all of these things. And like all wish-granting fables, it also occasionally reinforced that tired old saying: Be careful... 

  Hey, and let’s not forget the pornography! It more than anything else brings us all together; uniting pervert with fellow pervert. The porn industry is one of the largest industries in the world, and is in no small way driving many of the technological innovations of this century. There isn’t a demographic of people not represented in porn, and there isn’t a demographic of people alive that doesn't partake in its abundant offerings. 

  Right now, for instance, between that last sentence and the one I’m currently writing, I spent 3 hours browsing vast searchable catalogues of pornography from a single website (and there are fucking millions of them!). And, truth be told, I didn’t even masturbate. I just did it because I didn’t have anything particularly interesting to say in that moment, and rather than sit quietly and, “think,” I did what everyone does in this generation. I used technology as a gloriously effective intellectual security blanket. 

  And that’s just half the story. As humans collectively invest more and more of their time into The Internet (mostly for porn, also occasionally pictures of baby animals), and continue developing new, more immediate ways means of access (again, mostly to get at the porny bits), we come ever closer to true experience of these moments in a way that would seem magical to anyone who hadn’t grown up with it. Simply put, this whole writing and reading thing is becoming such a tedious and unnecessary first step in the process toward creation. 

  You see, reader, I consider myself a traditionalist in some respects. The fact that I am currently engaged in typing this on a typewriter older than my grandfather, instead of just live-tweeting it all from my newest pair of Google Glasses, should be proof enough of that. Yet even so - and I hesitate even being so candid with you, Dearest Reader – I often find myself listening to audiobooks now, rather than carrying on with the lie of reading. What a hypocrite I am, I know. Just understand that I place no expectations on you, as even I can’t stand to read these damn things anymore.  And in return, I hope you’ll do the same for me. 

  I guess what I’m getting at with all this is that I shouldn’t really make any promises about this book of mine. I don’t want you to have any illusions going into this thing. Yes, I’m writing a book, and between my half-assed writing, someone else’s half-assed editing, and the marvels of computer software that I don’t fully understand at present, but which is unquestionably smarter and more dedicated than either myself or my hypothetical editor, maybe it’ll turn out okay in the end. Just don’t hold me to it. 

  And here I’m reminded of the opening passage of The Odyssey, which beseeched the following: </p>

  <p>Make this tale live for us in all its many bearings, O muse… </p>

  <p>So hopefully someone from The Internet will one day come along and feel inspired enough, or will be paid enough, to then create a charming audio version of it, or, even better, a VR world, so that you may actually find yourself experiencing these words, being able to walk around and explore these spaces. Because that, friends, is the future. And until these words are vocalized, or added as a novel Easter egg within one of those alternate worlds (irony not lost here), my only audience is likely to be the opportunistic media-scanning robot spiders trawling the web, to which I issue my most humble gratitude. I hope you found my data points entirely sufficient for your consumption. But I’ve digressed…

  Where was I? Ah, yes, intentions. Unlike our future immortal and unfeeling robot overlords, I understand that people have sentiment, and such precious little time to consume this thing or that. And quite frankly, they hate to be jerked around. So in the unlikely event that human eyes ever do find themselves wandering along these lines, I want to make that perfectly clear from the start, that if and when things go awry, at least you know that I began, as we all so often do, with the noblest of intentions. 

  Now as for those intentions: </p>

  <p>
  (Another 3 weeks and countless porn-watching sessions transpire.) 
  </p>
  <p>
  If I’m speaking ideally, and if this was really going to become something great, it would need to achieve a timeless quality - to capture a specific point along the space/time continuum in a way that simultaneously manages to transcend both. It should address the same concerns that have plagued men throughout the ages, addressing dilemmas and questions like, “What is the purpose of this life?,” “What is reality?,” “What is love, and why do I think I need it so much?” and perhaps most importantly, to respond meaningfully to the dilemma of needing to quickly repay creditors (Just ask Dostoevsky about that one. Some things never change). But at the same time, it needs to be firmly rooted in today.
 
  I need to somehow address all those macro issues from the perspective of this speck of a transmitter in this tiny, blurry pixel that is our universe. And I must do so in a way that somehow manages to sway people who were bored enough read (or watch, or listen) to my ultimate cause (yet undecided). In short, it should be a witty romp, a self-referential, and thought-provoking commercial failure, which after my tragic suicide is reconsidered, perhaps several times, and eventually deemed an uncompromising success. In short: I’m going to write the last great, and legible, American novel, that anyone bothered to actually write.
 
  Failing that (chances are looking pretty good at this point), these hundred-or-so pages must at least bear all the emotional baggage of so many nights of my life spent wondering where my place was on this wild, spectacular ride we all choose to take part in, and all the subsequent nights spent wallowing in self-pity after having concluded, upon careful reflection, that I have no place to call my own (And then all the OTHER subsequent nights wallowing in self-pity that I wasted those first subsequent nights wallowing in the first place, and so on ad infinitum). But I persist to write myself into one, despite having no particular “background,” or “natural ability,” in writing. 

  I acknowledge as well, that I have nothing to say that hasn’t already been said countless times before by infinitely more gifted word-smiths. But the reasons for writing are eternal, and their pull inescapable. So I will continue, not because I believe I will succeed, or that I could ever hope to produce the kind of beauty and insight that has come before me, but because it is clear to me that this is a life-or-death struggle, and while I am ill-equipped to face it, this... this most ancient form of existential therapy, is all I have to extract the crystallized moments that illuminate my life - those moments that are either too important to forget, or too painful to keep remembering. The successes past and failures lingering. The unattainable dreams and relentless nightmares.
 
  And also those moments that just get stuck in one’s head for seemingly no reason at all – like that night my dad bought me McDonald’s on the way to drop me off at my mom’s after our bi-monthly weekend visit, or those summer mornings listening to Our Lady Peace or Smashing Pumpkins, while riding the lawn-mower in circles under the hot Indiana sun, going far too quickly to cut the grass to my step-dad’s satisfaction, ever-distracted by the crushing thoughts of life’s impermanence. And of course, the girls… always the girls. Lifetimes of potential have been wasted fantasizing about all the beautiful female figures I would try to see later, yearning to connect with in some meaningful way, before the moments themselves were relegated to faulty memory.  I must somehow put all of that into something that can then be hidden away forever on a wall in some unused room, or into a piece of unheard music, or in this case, on a few pages at the back of a cluttered, dust-covered bookshelf. 

  And speaking of girls...

  Reader, I would be lying to you if I pretended that all of my motives for writing this novel were as noble as the unwavering need to relay our unique but shared, and occasionally pretty rotten human experience. There are, as the more cynical among you have surely suspected, ulterior motives for this endeavor, as is the case with just about everything. Principally, there is the matter of that oft-whispered-about, mythical materialization of what I call they call the ‘fangirl blowjob’. Ah, you detest? “Surely in this age of the internet and all its distractions,” you say, “writing is no more the lonely, isolated occupation that it once was.” And perhaps you’re right, dearest reader. Today, aspiring hipster authors can spend countless hours over their portable typewriters in a crowded coffee shop, or chatting it up with strangers in an internet chat room while they work, and I’ve done plenty of both, regrettably enough. 

  Many a night have I spent drunkenly staring at the fruitless efforts of my wasted time; shedding all remnants of pride in a desperate bid for companionship (read: distraction), that I too have thrown myself at the mercy of casino-style online chat rooms, in which strangers are randomly sequestered into private rooms - most of them horny men in the 12-47 demographic – to have what would ideally be a more personal, friendly, and potentially thought-provoking conversation than is offered by  standard, mob-rule chat rooms. 

  If there is a saving grace to these male-dominated, one-on-one rooms, it’s democracy!  Where the open rooms are generally anarchistic free-for-alls of self-exploitation and perplexingly-bright fonts, barrages of racial slurs, emoticon bombs, and Vonnegutesque declarations of penile statitude, the one-on-one rooms give you the freedom to cast a vote that decides whether or not you keep talking to the person you were paired off with. Allow me to illustrate how such an encounter might take place, as though any of you are unaware. You can’t fool me, Reader. 

  It will typically begin with something like, “Hi, I’m Sean. I’m 16, and I like women with big butts and tattoos. ASL?” Now for Sean here, the wait time for that lucky lady with inked skin and a big ol’ booty could be several hours, if at all. In the meantime, Sean will confide his proclivity for rumptuous women to a virtually uninterrupted stampede of masturbating men, a cascade of cocks, most exiling him to another place in the world while continuing their own exploitive searches. You get the picture.
  </p>
  </p>

  The point is... Wait, what is the point of all this? Ah, yes. The point is that when it comes down to the real writing, when it comes to descending into that well of the soul in the hopes of finding another monster inside whose blood you can splatter onto the page in an attempt to save yourself, that is a journey that we all must take alone. 
And in that dark loneliness, a source of odd comfort to many writers, what often pulls me out when I believe I may have lost myself in searching, is that one day, if I can just find my way back out, I might make something legible, and thought-provoking enough to warrant a beautiful stranger giving me a blowjob for it – no strings attached, unless I want, which I will tell myself I do, even though I don’t.
